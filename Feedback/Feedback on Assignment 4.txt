Well done on Q5 and Q6

-------------------------------
Q7 You’re on the right track by asking the user for numbers and trying to stop the loop when they type 'q'. 
However, there are a few issues:
The for iteration in (value) line doesn’t work because value is an integer, and you can’t loop over a number.
You’re not keeping track of how many numbers are even or odd, so the program doesn’t answer the question.
If the user types 'q' when asked for a number, the program tries to convert it to an integer and crashes.
Some variables, like number and pie, aren’t used, and the loop is more complicated than it needs to be.
To fix it, you’d need to check for 'q' before converting input to an integer, and use counters to count even 
and odd numbers.
